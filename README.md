There are also descriptions and images for each course. The aim of the project is to understand component and props logic.

## image
In the project, we gave a form. Whatever we write to the input in the form will bring the desired pictures and display them on the screen thanks to the access key received from Unsplash Developer. Axios last update was made.

## state-project
The project includes an application that randomly selects a set of course names and displays them on the screen. The Course component takes the courseName prop and displays the corresponding image on the screen.  The source (src) of the image is determined by the image file corresponding to the courseName prop using the courseMap object.
